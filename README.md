# Unilog_Reproduction
Reproduction of Unilog using ðŸ¤—

I attempted to replicate a versatile log analysis model called Unilog in this [UniLog: Deploy One Model and Specialize it for All Log Analysis Tasks
 technical report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.03159) by Yichen Zhu, Weibin Meng, Ying Liu, Shenglin Zhang, Tao Han, Shimin Tao, Dan Pei

There are many areas for improvement, so I would appreciate any advice. Thank you! ðŸ¤—
